It is not about running individual campaigns in isolation but about weaving together all digital channels\u2014search, social media, email, paid advertising, website optimisation, and content marketing\u2014into a single, integrated system. The result is a customer journey that feels seamless and consistent, no matter where or how your audience interacts with your business.<\/p>\n<p data-start=\"560\" data-end=\"1190\">The core concept is simple: rather than treating SEO, social media, PPC, and email marketing as separate entities, a 360\u00b0 approach positions them as interdependent levers of growth. Each channel feeds into the other, amplifying results through integration. For example, high-quality blog content created for SEO can be repurposed for social media posts, email newsletters, and even paid advertising creatives. Paid search and display campaigns capture high-intent traffic and retarget visitors, while email nurtures leads until they are ready to buy. When executed under one strategy, these elements compound instead of competing.<\/p>\n<p data-start=\"1192\" data-end=\"1637\">The difference between a 360\u00b0 strategy and standalone campaigns is impact and efficiency. Standalone efforts may achieve short-term wins but often create blind spots, duplicated spend, and inconsistent messaging. Customers don\u2019t move through neat, linear funnels; they bounce between platforms, devices, and content types before deciding. A 360\u00b0 approach acknowledges this reality and builds marketing systems that match real consumer behaviour.<\/p>\n<p data-start=\"1639\" data-end=\"2235\">Integration between channels matters because today\u2019s consumer journey is complex and non-linear. A potential buyer might discover your brand on Instagram, research it through Google, watch a YouTube review, see a retargeting ad on Facebook, and finally convert after receiving an email or SMS reminder. If each of these steps is handled separately, the brand voice risks becoming fragmented, the customer experience disjointed, and valuable data lost. By aligning all channels under one cohesive plan, you reduce friction, lower acquisition costs, and build trust through consistent storytelling.<\/p>\n<p data-start=\"2237\" data-end=\"2933\">Consider a practical example. A Kenyan e-commerce store launches a campaign for a new product line. SEO-optimised blog posts attract organic traffic searching for solutions. Paid Google Ads capture high-intent buyers searching product keywords. Social media ads build awareness and grow remarketing audiences. Email and SMS campaigns nurture hesitant shoppers with limited-time offers. Meanwhile, conversion rate optimisation ensures the landing pages convert traffic into sales. Analytics tie everything together, showing which touchpoints drive the highest ROI and where to adjust budget. Instead of operating in silos, all channels reinforce each other, leading to stronger, measurable growth.<\/p>\n<p data-start=\"2935\" data-end=\"3240\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">This is the essence of a 360\u00b0 digital marketing strategy: a holistic, data-driven framework that turns fragmented activities into a single growth engine. It ensures every shilling spent contributes to a bigger, more connected picture\u2014making your marketing not only more efficient but also more profitable.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text css=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2 data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"56\">Key Components of Our 360\u00b0 Digital Marketing Strategy in Kenya<\/h2>\n<p data-start=\"58\" data-end=\"339\">A true 360\u00b0 strategy is not built overnight. It follows a structured framework that combines research, planning, execution, and continuous optimisation. At amini Digital, we break this into six core components that ensure every campaign is integrated, measurable, and growth-focused.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"341\" data-end=\"367\">Discovery &amp; Research<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"368\" data-end=\"1048\">The first step is to understand the market environment. We begin with competitor analysis to see which channels your rivals dominate, what kind of creative they are running, and how much visibility they are gaining. We then map industry trends, drawing insights from both Kenyan and global markets, because digital behaviour in Nairobi may differ from Mombasa, and local nuances matter. Customer persona development follows, where we identify your buyer segments, their needs, and the digital touchpoints they trust most. Finally, we audit your current marketing efforts\u2014traffic sources, content quality, ad performance, and conversion rates\u2014so we know what to keep, fix, or drop.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1050\" data-end=\"1075\">Goal Setting &amp; KPIs<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1076\" data-end=\"1556\">Without clear goals, digital marketing becomes guesswork. We define specific revenue targets, conversion rate benchmarks, and engagement goals. For corporates, we track leads and sales pipeline growth; for NGOs, we set donation or awareness targets. Cost-focused KPIs such as Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) are also included, giving a clear picture of efficiency and long-term profitability. This makes every activity accountable and measurable.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1558\" data-end=\"1595\">Channel Selection &amp; Integration<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1596\" data-end=\"1719\">A 360\u00b0 strategy is only as strong as the channels it unites. We select and connect those that matter most to your business:<\/p>\n<ul data-start=\"1721\" data-end=\"2515\">\n<li data-start=\"1721\" data-end=\"1834\">\n<p data-start=\"1723\" data-end=\"1834\"><strong data-start=\"1723\" data-end=\"1730\">SEO<\/strong> for long-term visibility through on-page optimisation, technical improvements, and backlink building.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-start=\"1835\" data-end=\"1941\">\n<p data-start=\"1837\" data-end=\"1941\"><strong data-start=\"1837\" data-end=\"1858\">Content marketing<\/strong> such as blogs, guides, and video to capture attention and educate your audience.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-start=\"1942\" data-end=\"2040\">\n<p data-start=\"1944\" data-end=\"2040\"><strong data-start=\"1944\" data-end=\"1995\">Social media marketing and community management<\/strong> to build engagement and amplify campaigns.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-start=\"2041\" data-end=\"2154\">\n<p data-start=\"2043\" data-end=\"2154\"><strong data-start=\"2043\" data-end=\"2057\">Paid media<\/strong> including Google Ads, social ads, display campaigns, and YouTube pre-rolls for targeted reach.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-start=\"2155\" data-end=\"2256\">\n<p data-start=\"2157\" data-end=\"2256\"><strong data-start=\"2157\" data-end=\"2195\">Email and SMS marketing automation<\/strong> to nurture leads with personalisation and timely triggers.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-start=\"2257\" data-end=\"2336\">\n<p data-start=\"2259\" data-end=\"2336\"><strong data-start=\"2259\" data-end=\"2283\">Influencer marketing<\/strong> to reach new audiences and strengthen credibility.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-start=\"2337\" data-end=\"2427\">\n<p data-start=\"2339\" data-end=\"2427\"><strong data-start=\"2339\" data-end=\"2377\">Conversion rate optimisation (CRO)<\/strong> to ensure traffic converts into leads or sales.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-start=\"2428\" data-end=\"2515\">\n<p data-start=\"2430\" data-end=\"2515\"><strong data-start=\"2430\" data-end=\"2457\">Analytics and reporting<\/strong> to unify all data and track performance across platforms.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p data-start=\"2517\" data-end=\"2706\">Integration is the key\u2014SEO informs PPC keyword targeting, PPC provides remarketing audiences for social, and social generates data that feeds email campaigns. Nothing operates in isolation.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"2708\" data-end=\"2743\">Campaign Planning &amp; Messaging<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"2744\" data-end=\"3183\">Once the channels are chosen, we develop a unified campaign blueprint. This includes defining the brand voice and ensuring it is consistent across platforms, whether in a tweet, a Google ad, or an email subject line. Creative concepts are designed to carry across multiple channels while remaining tailored for each platform. We create content calendars, ad creatives, and messaging frameworks that ensure alignment and reduce duplication.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"3185\" data-end=\"3213\">Execution &amp; Management<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"3214\" data-end=\"3635\">Campaigns are launched in structured phases. We stagger launches to allow testing and avoid overwhelming audiences. Continuous monitoring across all channels ensures we spot issues early and adjust. Cross-platform remarketing is applied so that someone who clicked a Facebook ad but didn\u2019t purchase will later see a Google Display ad or receive an SMS reminder. The aim is to move users through the funnel with precision.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"3637\" data-end=\"3666\">Tracking &amp; Optimisation<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"3667\" data-end=\"4055\">Every campaign is monitored against the KPIs defined earlier. We run A\/B tests on creatives, landing pages, and emails to continuously improve results. Budgets are reallocated towards high-performing channels, and low-return campaigns are either restructured or stopped. Optimisation is ongoing, not occasional. High-ROI campaigns are scaled while ensuring profitability remains in check.<\/p>\n<p data-start=\"4057\" data-end=\"4264\">This structured approach makes the difference between scattered activity and a coordinated growth engine. It ensures that all marketing spend contributes to one clear direction: measurable business growth.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row bg_type=&#8221;bg_color&#8221;][vc_column][vc_cta h2=&#8221;Need a full digital marketing strategy?&#8221; h2_font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23000000&#8243; h2_use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; h2_css_animation=&#8221;fadeInLeft&#8221; h4_font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:left|color:%230A0A0A&#8221; h4_use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; shape=&#8221;square&#8221; style=&#8221;flat&#8221; color=&#8221;grey&#8221; add_button=&#8221;right&#8221; btn_title=&#8221;Contact Us&#8221; btn_shape=&#8221;square&#8221; btn_color=&#8221;warning&#8221; btn_i_align=&#8221;right&#8221; btn_i_icon_fontawesome=&#8221;fa fa-solid fa-paper-plane&#8221; btn_css_animation=&#8221;bounceIn&#8221; css=&#8221;&#8221; use_custom_fonts_h2=&#8221;true&#8221; use_custom_fonts_h4=&#8221;true&#8221; btn_add_icon=&#8221;true&#8221; btn_link=&#8221;url:%23!%2Fcontact&#8221;]Talk to our experts today.[\/vc_cta][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text css=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2 data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"50\">Benefits of a 360\u00b0 Digital Marketing Strategy<\/h2>\n<p data-start=\"52\" data-end=\"283\">A properly executed 360\u00b0 digital marketing strategy delivers benefits that go far beyond running isolated campaigns. By unifying every touchpoint, businesses in Kenya can transform how they attract, convert, and retain customers.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"285\" data-end=\"333\">Unified Brand Presence Across All Channels<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"334\" data-end=\"932\">One of the strongest benefits is brand consistency. When your messaging, tone, and visuals are aligned across Google search results, Facebook ads, YouTube videos, email campaigns, and your website, customers perceive your business as more trustworthy and professional. Inconsistency creates doubt; consistency builds recognition. Research indicates that brands maintaining consistent presentation across all platforms can increase revenue by up to 23%. This is especially critical in competitive markets such as retail, e-commerce, and financial services, where trust influences buying decisions.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"934\" data-end=\"980\">Better ROI From Interconnected Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"981\" data-end=\"1536\">Integration ensures that spend in one channel supports performance in another. For instance, the data collected from SEO keyword research can inform your paid search campaigns, improving ad efficiency. Retargeting audiences from social ads can be used in Google Display or YouTube, lowering acquisition costs. Email marketing performs better when it is supported by search and social campaigns feeding the subscriber pipeline. Instead of each channel working in isolation, they reinforce one another, compounding ROI and maximising every shilling spent.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1538\" data-end=\"1588\">More Accurate Attribution of Sales and Leads<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1589\" data-end=\"2063\">In fragmented campaigns, it\u2019s often unclear which channel is driving results. Was it the Facebook ad, the Google search, or the email follow-up? A 360\u00b0 strategy solves this with unified analytics and cross-channel tracking. With clear attribution models, businesses can see exactly how a customer journey unfolded\u2014from the first click to final purchase\u2014and allocate budget more intelligently. This reduces waste and directs investment into the highest-performing channels.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"2065\" data-end=\"2111\">Improved Customer Experience and Loyalty<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"2112\" data-end=\"2678\">A seamless journey across platforms reduces friction and frustration. Customers no longer feel bombarded with disjointed messages; instead, they encounter a logical flow of information that matches where they are in the decision-making process. For example, a prospect may first see an awareness ad on Instagram, read an educational blog post optimised for SEO, receive a targeted follow-up via email, and then complete a purchase after a retargeting ad. This structured experience makes customers feel understood and valued, increasing loyalty and lifetime value.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"2680\" data-end=\"2708\">Scalability for Growth<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"2709\" data-end=\"3176\">Because a 360\u00b0 strategy is built on systems, it can scale efficiently. As your business grows, you don\u2019t have to reinvent your marketing for each new product or service. The framework is already in place, with customer personas, content guidelines, and analytics infrastructure, so campaigns can be expanded quickly while maintaining alignment. This is particularly valuable for Kenyan e-commerce stores scaling nationally or service providers expanding into regional markets.<\/p>\n<p data-start=\"3178\" data-end=\"3370\">The overall benefit is clear: a 360\u00b0 strategy doesn\u2019t just improve marketing efficiency; it reshapes business growth by aligning resources, reducing waste, and delivering measurable results.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text css=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2 data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"31\">Who Needs a 360\u00b0 Digital Marketing Strategy in Kenya?<\/h2>\n<p data-start=\"33\" data-end=\"267\">Not every business needs a fully fledged 360\u00b0 digital marketing strategy, but for organisations aiming to scale, compete, and measure ROI with precision, it is no longer optional. In Kenya, the following categories benefit the most:<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"269\" data-end=\"302\">Medium to Large Enterprises<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"303\" data-end=\"720\">Companies with multiple products or service lines require consistent brand messaging across departments, markets, and customer segments. A 360\u00b0 strategy prevents fragmented campaigns and ensures that brand visibility is unified across all digital touchpoints. This is particularly relevant for corporates in finance, real estate, healthcare, and telecoms where competition is intense and customer journeys are long.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"722\" data-end=\"778\">E-commerce Stores Scaling Nationally or Regionally<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"779\" data-end=\"1166\">Kenya\u2019s e-commerce market is expanding quickly, fuelled by mobile money adoption and increased internet penetration. E-commerce brands that want to move beyond small-scale campaigns and establish themselves nationally need a system that combines SEO, paid ads, email marketing, and CRO. A 360\u00b0 strategy allows them to scale demand generation while keeping acquisition costs manageable.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1168\" data-end=\"1222\">NGOs Running Awareness and Fundraising Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1223\" data-end=\"1600\">For NGOs, donor engagement and awareness cannot rely on a single channel. Campaigns that combine search visibility, social storytelling, email nurturing, and influencer amplification perform better than one-off initiatives. Integrated strategies make it easier to attribute which channel is driving donations and allow resources to be shifted to the most effective platforms.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1602\" data-end=\"1659\">Service-Based Businesses Expanding Into New Markets<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1660\" data-end=\"2017\">Professional services such as law firms, consultancies, logistics providers, and healthcare providers need cross-platform visibility to establish credibility in new regions. A 360\u00b0 approach ensures that when potential clients research them online, they encounter a consistent and authoritative presence across search engines, social media, and paid media.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"2019\" data-end=\"2077\">Brands Needing Consistent Awareness and Sales Growth<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"2078\" data-end=\"2387\">Whether it is a consumer goods company or a B2B software provider, consistent multi-channel exposure builds long-term brand equity. A 360\u00b0 strategy ensures that advertising, organic search, content marketing, and community engagement reinforce one another to drive both awareness and measurable conversions.<\/p>\n<p data-start=\"2389\" data-end=\"2581\">In short, any business or organisation that cannot afford wasted spend, inconsistent messaging, or guesswork in attribution stands to gain from a fully integrated digital marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row bg_type=&#8221;bg_color&#8221;][vc_column][vc_cta h2=&#8221;Let\u2019s discuss how to connect all your marketing channels.&#8221; h2_font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23000000&#8243; h2_use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; h2_css_animation=&#8221;fadeInLeft&#8221; h4_font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:left|color:%230A0A0A&#8221; h4_use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; shape=&#8221;square&#8221; style=&#8221;flat&#8221; color=&#8221;grey&#8221; add_button=&#8221;right&#8221; btn_title=&#8221;Contact Us&#8221; btn_shape=&#8221;square&#8221; btn_color=&#8221;warning&#8221; btn_i_align=&#8221;right&#8221; btn_i_icon_fontawesome=&#8221;fa fa-solid fa-paper-plane&#8221; btn_css_animation=&#8221;bounceIn&#8221; css=&#8221;&#8221; use_custom_fonts_h2=&#8221;true&#8221; use_custom_fonts_h4=&#8221;true&#8221; btn_add_icon=&#8221;true&#8221; btn_link=&#8221;url:%23!%2Fcontact&#8221;]Talk to us today.[\/vc_cta][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text css=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2 data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"55\">amini Digital\u2019s Process for Building 360\u00b0 Digital Marketing Strategies<\/h2>\n<p data-start=\"57\" data-end=\"344\">At amini Digital, we don\u2019t believe in generic plans. Every 360\u00b0 digital marketing strategy we build follows a structured process that aligns with a client\u2019s specific goals, industry context, and budget realities. This ensures that campaigns are both tailored and measurable from day one.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"346\" data-end=\"384\">Step 1: Onboarding and Discovery<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"385\" data-end=\"714\">We begin with a deep dive into your business model, objectives, and challenges. This includes workshops with your leadership and marketing teams, audits of your existing digital presence, and a review of your sales funnel. We also benchmark your competitors and map out your customer journey to identify gaps and opportunities.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"716\" data-end=\"748\">Step 2: Strategy Blueprint<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"749\" data-end=\"1092\">Our teams\u2014SEO, PPC, social, and content\u2014collaborate to design a single, integrated strategy. We set objectives linked directly to business outcomes such as revenue growth, market share expansion, or donor acquisition. At this stage, we define KPIs, budgets, and timelines, creating a blueprint that ensures every channel supports the others.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1094\" data-end=\"1138\">Step 3: Creative and Campaign Planning<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1139\" data-end=\"1424\">We then translate strategy into execution plans. This involves building detailed content calendars, ad creative concepts, campaign frameworks, and messaging guidelines. The emphasis is on consistent brand voice across all channels, with enough flexibility to adapt for each platform.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1426\" data-end=\"1465\">Step 4: Execution Across Channels<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1466\" data-end=\"1779\">Campaigns are launched in coordinated phases. For example, SEO groundwork is laid in parallel with paid search campaigns, while social and email campaigns run with cross-channel remarketing. Our execution is carefully staged to gather insights early, test assumptions, and refine messaging before scaling spend.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1781\" data-end=\"1820\">Step 5: Measurement and Reporting<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1821\" data-end=\"2166\">All campaigns are tracked through unified dashboards that consolidate data across channels. This enables clear attribution, showing how each touchpoint contributes to leads, sales, or donations. Reports are delivered in simple, actionable formats so decision-makers can quickly see where performance is strong and where adjustments are needed.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"2168\" data-end=\"2206\">Step 6: Optimisation and Scaling<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"2207\" data-end=\"2512\">We don\u2019t stop at execution. Through regular reviews and A\/B testing, we optimise budgets, creatives, and targeting. High-performing campaigns are scaled, while underperforming ones are restructured or paused. This ensures continuous improvement and long-term growth rather than short bursts of activity.<\/p>\n<p data-start=\"2514\" data-end=\"2736\">Our process is designed to replace fragmented marketing with one cohesive engine. By aligning teams, tools, and tactics, amini Digital delivers strategies that are integrated, measurable, and focused on sustainable growth.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text css=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2 data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"49\">Case Studies \u2013 360\u00b0 Strategy Success Stories<\/h2>\n<p data-start=\"51\" data-end=\"306\">A 360\u00b0 strategy is not theory; it is practical and measurable. At amini Digital, we\u2019ve seen how coordinated, cross-channel strategies deliver growth across industries in Kenya. Here are a few examples that demonstrate the impact of an integrated approach.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"308\" data-end=\"365\">E-commerce Fashion Brand: +120% Revenue in 9 Months<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"366\" data-end=\"866\">A Nairobi-based fashion e-commerce store approached us with fragmented campaigns. SEO was run separately, social ads were inconsistent, and there was no remarketing. We built a 360\u00b0 strategy that combined technical SEO, content marketing, Google Shopping Ads, Facebook and Instagram retargeting, email automation, and CRO for their product pages. Within nine months, their organic traffic grew by 80%, paid campaigns achieved a 4.2x return on ad spend (ROAS), and overall revenue increased by 120%.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row bg_type=&#8221;bg_color&#8221;][vc_column][vc_cta h2=&#8221;Talk to our team about building a growth-focused strategy.&#8221; h2_font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23000000&#8243; h2_use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; h2_css_animation=&#8221;fadeInLeft&#8221; h4_font_container=&#8221;tag:h4|text_align:left|color:%230A0A0A&#8221; h4_use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; shape=&#8221;square&#8221; style=&#8221;flat&#8221; color=&#8221;grey&#8221; add_button=&#8221;right&#8221; btn_title=&#8221;Contact Us&#8221; btn_shape=&#8221;square&#8221; btn_color=&#8221;warning&#8221; btn_i_align=&#8221;right&#8221; btn_i_icon_fontawesome=&#8221;fa fa-solid fa-paper-plane&#8221; btn_css_animation=&#8221;bounceIn&#8221; css=&#8221;&#8221; use_custom_fonts_h2=&#8221;true&#8221; use_custom_fonts_h4=&#8221;true&#8221; btn_add_icon=&#8221;true&#8221; btn_link=&#8221;url:%23!%2Fcontact&#8221;]Our specialists will map a tailored framework that aligns directly with your sales or fundraising goals.[\/vc_cta][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text css=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2 data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"48\">Why Choose amini Digital for 360\u00b0 Strategies?<\/h2>\n<p data-start=\"50\" data-end=\"417\">Selecting the right agency for a 360\u00b0 digital marketing strategy is not just about finding someone who can run ads or post on social media.

Here\u2019s why amini Digital is trusted by SMEs, corporates, NGOs, and e-commerce brands in Kenya:<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"419\" data-end=\"453\">Proven Track Record in Kenya<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"454\" data-end=\"935\">We have been at the forefront of digital marketing in Kenya for more than a decade, serving organisations across publishing, retail, e-commerce, education, healthcare, and NGOs. Our clients rely on us to deliver strategies that not only drive traffic but also convert into leads, sales, and donations. This experience allows us to anticipate challenges and tailor solutions to Kenya\u2019s unique digital landscape, from mobile-first browsing to the dominance of M-Pesa in e-commerce.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"937\" data-end=\"981\">Integrated, Cross-Functional Expertise<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"982\" data-end=\"1434\">Unlike agencies that specialise in only one or two channels, amini Digital brings together SEO specialists, paid media strategists, content creators, social media managers, designers, and data analysts under one roof. Each team collaborates on strategy and execution so that campaigns are consistent, measurable, and mutually reinforcing. For example, SEO insights feed directly into PPC campaigns, while social media data shapes email personalisation.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1436\" data-end=\"1484\">Local Market Insight With Global Standards<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1485\" data-end=\"1922\">We understand Kenyan consumer behaviour and purchasing patterns while applying global best practices. Our campaigns account for local nuances\u2014such as regional languages, mobile-first habits, and trust in community recommendations\u2014while using world-class tools like Google Analytics 4, Looker Studio, and advanced marketing automation platforms. This combination ensures campaigns resonate locally but compete at an international level.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1924\" data-end=\"1967\">Data-Driven and Transparent Reporting<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1968\" data-end=\"2323\">Every shilling spent is tracked and accounted for.

We remove the guesswork so you can make confident, evidence-based marketing decisions.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"2325\" data-end=\"2366\">Focus on Growth, Not Vanity Metrics<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"2367\" data-end=\"2652\">We don\u2019t sell likes or clicks\u2014we measure success in terms of revenue, donations, leads, and customer lifetime value. Our strategies are designed to lower acquisition costs and increase returns over time, turning marketing into a sustainable growth engine rather than an expense line.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"2654\" data-end=\"2692\">Compliance and Ethical Standards<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"2693\" data-end=\"3033\">For corporates and NGOs, compliance is critical.

This creates duplication, inconsistent messaging, and gaps in reporting. A 360\u00b0 strategy, by contrast, aligns all channels under one framework with shared KPIs and unified reporting. It eliminates silos, reduces wasted spend, and ensures every channel supports the same business objectives.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"583\" data-end=\"622\">Q2: How long until I see results?<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"623\" data-end=\"983\">Timelines depend on your industry, budget, and competition. Paid campaigns like Google Ads and social media ads can deliver results within weeks, while SEO and content marketing often take 3\u20136 months to show measurable gains. A well-executed 360\u00b0 strategy balances quick wins from paid media with sustainable long-term growth from organic and owned channels.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"985\" data-end=\"1048\">Q3: What\u2019s the minimum budget for an integrated strategy?<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1049\" data-end=\"1472\">Budgets vary by business size and goals. For SMEs, effective 360\u00b0 strategies can start at around KES 100,000 per month, combining core channels such as SEO, paid search, and social ads. For corporates and NGOs running large-scale campaigns, budgets may range from KES 200,000 to several million. The important point is not the absolute spend but allocating resources strategically across channels to maximise ROI.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1474\" data-end=\"1533\">Q4: Can you adapt a 360\u00b0 plan for seasonal campaigns?<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1534\" data-end=\"1886\">Yes. Seasonal peaks such as back-to-school, Black Friday, or end-year giving are ideal for 360\u00b0 strategies. The framework allows us to ramp up spend on paid ads, refresh creative, and coordinate messaging across all channels while maintaining consistency. After the season, campaigns can be scaled back or shifted to focus on retention and nurturing.<\/p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1888\" data-end=\"1951\">Q5: Do you offer one-off campaigns or only ongoing plans?<\/h3>\n<p data-start=\"1952\" data-end=\"2305\">We recommend ongoing plans because 360\u00b0 strategies deliver their best results through continuous optimisation and compounding effects. However, we can adapt the approach for one-off launches, product rollouts, or seasonal events. In such cases, we compress the framework into a shorter timeline, ensuring campaigns are still integrated and measurable.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row equal_height=&#8221;yes&#8221; content_placement=&#8221;middle&#8221; type=&#8221;vc_default&#8221; margin_top=&#8221;5&#8243; margin_bottom=&#8221;10&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1716548610536{padding-top: 30px !important;padding-bottom: 30px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6167&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; css=&#8221;&#8221; lazy_loading=&#8221;true&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text css=&#8221;&#8221;] What Is a 360\u00b0 Digital Marketing Strategy?
