A significant shift has occurred as Universal Analytics has been replaced by Google Analytics 4 (GA4). This transition marks a pivotal moment for businesses and marketers who rely on analytics data to understand and optimise their online presence. With GA4, Google aims to provide more advanced and comprehensive insights into user behaviour across multiple platforms and devices. Although the decommissioning of UA has commenced, Google has advised that it will be phased out, which explains why some data is still accessible. Why should you care? Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest version of Google&#8217;s analytics platform. It is a significant upgrade from Universal Analytics (UA), which is the current default version. GA4 is more powerful, more flexible, and more privacy-focused than UA. We will go ahead and explore what this transition means, the key differences between Universal Analytics and GA4, and guide you through the process of migrating from Universal Analytics to GA4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_80 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-grey ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title ez-toc-toggle\" style=\"cursor:pointer\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\" aria-label=\"Toggle Table of Content\"><span class=\"ez-toc-js-icon-con\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"eztoc-hide\" style=\"display:none;\">Toggle<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-icon-toggle-span\"><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" class=\"list-377408\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M6 6H4v2h2V6zm14 0H8v2h12V6zM4 11h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2zM4 16h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2z\" fill=\"currentColor\"><\/path><\/svg><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" class=\"arrow-unsorted-368013\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"10px\" height=\"10px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.2\" baseProfile=\"tiny\"><path d=\"M18.2 9.3l-6.2-6.3-6.2 6.3c-.2.2-.3.4-.3.7s.1.5.3.7c.2.2.4.3.7.3h11c.3 0 .5-.1.7-.3.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7zM5.8 14.7l6.2 6.3 6.2-6.3c.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7c-.2-.2-.4-.3-.7-.3h-11c-.3 0-.5.1-.7.3-.2.2-.3.5-.3.7s.1.5.3.7z\"\/><\/svg><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/aminidigital.co.ke\/blog\/website-design\/universal-analytics-has-officially-been-replaced-by-ga4-what-it-means-and-how-to-migrate\/#I_Understanding_Universal_Analytics\" >I.

Understanding Universal Analytics<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal Analytics, the predecessor to GA4, has been the go-to web analytics platform for businesses for many years. It allowed marketers to track and analyse user interactions on websites, providing valuable insights into user behaviour, conversion tracking, and attribution modelling. Universal Analytics primarily focused on website-based analytics, providing businesses with the tools to measure and optimise their online performance effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Universal Analytics had its limitations. It primarily relied on cookies for tracking user interactions, which presented challenges in tracking user journeys across different devices and platforms. Additionally, as the digital landscape evolved, user behaviour started shifting towards mobile apps and other emerging platforms, which Universal Analytics struggled to capture comprehensively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"II_Introducing_GA4_Google_Analytics_4\"><\/span>II. Introducing GA4 (Google Analytics 4)<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognising the changing landscape and the need for more comprehensive insights, Google developed GA4 as the next generation of web analytics. GA4 is designed to bridge the gaps left by Universal Analytics and provide a more holistic view of user behaviour across websites, mobile apps, and other digital platforms. This transition represents a paradigm shift in how businesses can leverage analytics data to understand their audience and make data-driven decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GA4 introduces several key features and advantages over Universal Analytics. It utilises an event-driven data model that focuses on user interactions and events, allowing businesses to capture more granular data about user behaviour. This event-based approach enables businesses to track user actions such as page views, button clicks, video interactions, and other custom events, providing a richer understanding of user engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"III_Migrating_from_Universal_Analytics_to_GA4\"><\/span>III. Migrating from Universal Analytics to GA4<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/13486733?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Migrating from Universal Analytics to GA4<\/a> is a crucial step for businesses to unlock the advanced capabilities and benefits offered by GA4. While the migration process may seem daunting, it can be simplified by following a systematic approach. Here are the steps to migrate from Universal Analytics to GA4:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Pre-migration preparations:<\/strong> Before starting the migration process, it&#8217;s essential to assess your current Universal Analytics implementation, including tracking codes, goals, and custom dimensions. Take note of any custom configurations or reports that need to be replicated in GA4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Setting up a new GA4 property:<\/strong> Create a new GA4 property in your Google Analytics account. This will serve as the destination for your GA4 data. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to set up the property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Linking GA4 and Universal Analytics properties:<\/strong> Establish a connection between your existing Universal Analytics property and the newly created GA4 property. This allows data to flow from Universal Analytics to GA4 during the migration phase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Mapping data and configuring event tracking:<\/strong> Analyse the data collected in Universal Analytics and identify the events, goals, and dimensions that need to be replicated in GA4. Set up event tracking in GA4 to capture similar user interactions and actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Testing and validating the GA4 implementation:<\/strong> Conduct thorough testing to ensure that data is being accurately collected and tracked in GA4. Validate the implementation by comparing data from Universal Analytics and GA4 to identify any discrepancies or issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Decommissioning Universal Analytics:<\/strong> Once you are confident that the data is accurately tracked in GA4, you can proceed with decommissioning Universal Analytics. Ensure that all necessary reports, configurations, and customisations have been replicated in GA4 before shutting down Universal Analytics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By following these steps, you can smoothly migrate from Universal Analytics to GA4 and leverage the advanced features and capabilities that GA4 offers for enhanced data analysis and decision-making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"IV_Key_Differences_and_New_Features_in_GA4\"><\/span>IV.

These tools empower businesses to dive deeper into their data, uncover valuable insights, and make data-driven decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"V_Best_Practices_for_Utilising_GA4\"><\/span>V. Best Practices for Utilising GA4<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the most out of GA4, consider the following best practices:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Define Custom Events and Conversions:<\/strong> Identify key user interactions that align with your business goals and set them up as custom events or conversions in GA4. This allows you to track specific actions that indicate user engagement or conversion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Leverage Audience and User Segmentation:<\/strong> Utilise GA4&#8217;s audience and user segmentation capabilities to better understand and target specific user segments.
